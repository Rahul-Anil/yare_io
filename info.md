# Strat

- sending a squadren on units to the wihtin just around the 40 unit space of a enemy base is going to prevent the base from making enemy units
    - This will allow my attack squad to kill the enemy with much more ease 
    - I will have to send this attack unit after i send in my scounting unit
- decide on the number of units per squad depending on the number of total attack units that i have.    


# Problems 
- sometimes that star that comes in as the best star is the enemy star which i dont understand why but i will need to add an exclusion for this.
